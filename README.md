# SOLID Principles

_The SOLID principles were first conceptualized by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper, Design Principles and Design Patterns._

## Principles
- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

## Concepts
### Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have only a single responsibility.
### Open/Closed Principle
A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
### Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
### Interface Segregation Principle
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
### Dependency Inversion Principle
Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
- A high level class should not depend on low level classes. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
